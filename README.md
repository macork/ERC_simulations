Code for simulations for Michael Cork paper #1: Curving emissions: Comparing methods for evaluating exposure response curves

This respository contains code used to conduct simulation studies comparing methods for exposure-response curves. It also contains a data application to the Medicare databse. 

The main code scripts are as follows:
`0_launch.jobs.sh` is script to launch jobs on the FASSE cluster 

There are three main code directories in this repo:
1) Simulation studies which has the code 
2) Dan IPTW example which is a slightly different example
